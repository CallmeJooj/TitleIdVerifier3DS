# TitleID Verifier for 3DS Games
This is a simples python scraper to automatically search the title IDs of the games you have on your 3DS

I had this problem recently were i needed to verify which of the ID's in my 3DS were corrupted games that did not show on the system menu and created this.
Not all titles are going to have a match but it is still pretty useful.

## Tutorial
It is very simple:
- Put the executable inside your 3DS' title folder, that is: SD/Nintendo 3DS/*weird ID*/*another long ID*/title/
- Execute the file
- Done!
- In some time it'll scan the IDs in real time and show them to you. It'll also leave a txt file with the links and name of the titles
